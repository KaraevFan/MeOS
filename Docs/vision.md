# Vision

**MeOS is an AI life partner that helps people live intentionally.**

It's not a productivity tool. It's not a journaling app. It's not a coach. It's the first system that builds a persistent, evolving model of *who you are* — your values, tensions, goals, patterns, blind spots — and uses that model to help you make better decisions, stay aligned with what matters, and actually follow through.

The core mechanic is **conversation**. You talk. The AI listens, remembers, connects, challenges, and nudges. Over time, the system knows you better than any app, any planner, and most friends. That accumulated understanding is the product — and it's a moat that deepens with every interaction.

The long-term platform vision is a full Personal Operating System: intake, sense-making, planning, habit execution, learning, knowledge management, and public projection. But the entry point is radically simple: *help me figure out my life and keep me honest about it.*

# The Problem

There are two massive, overlapping populations being underserved:

**Population 1: Productivity tool bouncers.** Tens of millions of people who tried Notion, Obsidian, Todoist, journals, bullet journals, and every "second brain" YouTube system. They bought the course. They set up the templates. They used it for 2-3 weeks. Then they stopped. Not because the tools are bad, but because the tools require you to *already be organized* to use them. The setup cost is the product killer.

**Population 2: Stuck but capable.** People who are objectively talented and resourceful but feel scattered, unfocused, or misaligned. They're not broken. They don't need therapy (necessarily). They need what a great executive coach provides — someone who holds the full picture of their life and helps them see clearly. But coaching costs $200-500/hour and doesn't scale.

**The gap:** There is no product that (a) requires zero setup, (b) builds a deep model of you through natural conversation, (c) persists across months and years, and (d) actively helps you stay aligned with your own stated intentions. ChatGPT is brilliant but forgets you. Coaches remember but are expensive and scarce. Productivity apps remember but don't think.

# Why Now

Three things are converging:

1. **LLMs are finally good enough for sustained, personalized conversation.** Two years ago this product was impossible. The quality of sense-making, memory management, and conversational nuance in current models makes a persistent AI life partner viable for the first time.
2. **Voice interfaces are normalized.** People talk to Siri, Alexa, and ChatGPT voice mode daily. The behavioral barrier to "talking to an AI about your life" has collapsed.
3. **There's a cultural moment around intentional living.** The post-pandemic reckoning, the great resignation aftermath, the millennial midlife crisis wave, the ADHD diagnosis explosion — there's a massive population actively asking "what am I doing with my life?" and looking for tools to help.

# Core Insight

People can *talk* about their lives far more easily than they can write, organize, or plan. If AI can listen to unstructured verbal input and progressively structure it — without requiring the user to learn a system — you unlock the entire population that bounced off every productivity tool they've ever tried.

Most productivity systems start *after* the hard work of self-understanding and skip straight to execution. MeOS starts at the beginning: **who are you, what do you actually want, and what's getting in the way?**

# Product Strategy: The Layer Cake

Each layer is a complete product that delivers value on its own, but also feeds the next layer.

## Layer 0: The Onboarding Conversation (Life Mapping)

*"Tell me about your life."*

A 20-40 minute guided voice conversation where the AI walks you through:

- Where you are in life right now (work, relationships, health, finances, interests)
- What's working and what's not
- What you're curious about or drawn to
- What you've been avoiding
- What "a good year" would look like

**Output:** A structured life map — not a rigid plan, but a living document that captures your identity, priorities, active tensions, and stated intentions. The user sees it and thinks: *"Wow, this thing gets me."*

**This is the magic moment.** If we nail this, everything else follows. If we don't, nothing else matters.

## Layer 1: Recurring Reflections (The Retention Engine)

*"Let's check in."*

Weekly and quarterly guided conversations that:

- Review what happened since last time
- Compare reality to intentions
- Surface patterns ("You've mentioned feeling stuck on X three weeks in a row")
- Gently challenge ("You said this was your priority but you haven't touched it — what's going on?")
- Update the life map based on new information

**Key design principle:** These check-ins are not performance reviews. They're sense-making conversations — "what's actually happening and what does it mean?" The tone is curious and warm, not judgmental.

**Cadence:**

- Weekly: 5-10 min voice check-in (the core habit)
- Monthly: 15-20 min deeper review
- Quarterly: 30-45 min strategic reassessment

## Layer 2: Daily Nudging (The Ambient Layer)

*"Here's something to think about today."*

Once the system knows your life map and has weekly check-in data, it starts lightweight daily touches:

- Morning: "Today you said you wanted to focus on X. Your one thing is Y."
- Micro-prompts: "You mentioned wanting to reconnect with Z. Want to send them a message today?"
- Pattern alerts: "Your mood has been trending down for two weeks. Want to talk about it?"
- Wins: "You've been consistent with morning walks for 3 weeks. That's real."

**Design principle:** These should feel like a thoughtful friend texting you, not an app sending notifications. Sparse, well-timed, personalized.

## Layer 3+: Platform Expansion (The Long Game)

Once Layers 0-2 have product-market fit:

- **Habit stacking** — design and adapt habit routines tied to goals
- **Content/learning integration** — pull in newsletters, podcasts, articles and connect to interest graph
- **Project management** — decompose goals into projects with milestones
- **Knowledge graph** — all conversations and inputs create a searchable map of your thinking
- **Public projection** — optionally share your journey, learnings, or roadmap publicly
- **Community features** — accountability partners, shared challenges, group reflections

**None of this gets built until Layers 0-2 have retention.**

# Competitive Positioning

**Where MeOS sits:**

- **Notion / Obsidian:** Remembers you (if you maintain it), but doesn't talk to you, doesn't help you act, high friction
- **ChatGPT / Claude:** Talks to you, low friction, but doesn't truly remember you or drive action
- **Therapy:** Remembers you, talks to you, but expensive and not action-oriented
- **Executive coaching:** The closest analog — but costs $200-500/hr and doesn't scale
- **Habit apps (Streaks, etc.):** Low friction, but no understanding of you, no conversation
- **AI journals (Rosebud, etc.):** Somewhat conversational, but no life mapping, no accountability layer

**MeOS is uniquely: persistent understanding + conversational interface + action orientation + zero setup.**

The real competitive threat is ChatGPT adding persistent memory + proactive check-ins natively. Speed matters. The depth of the life model (built through structured conversations, not casual chat) is the moat.

# Target User

**"The Reflective Striver"**

- Age 25-40
- Knowledge worker, creative, or entrepreneur
- Has tried multiple productivity systems and bounced off them
- Feels capable but scattered or misaligned
- Probably has ADHD (diagnosed or suspected) or is high-optionality and overwhelmed
- Already talks to ChatGPT regularly — comfortable with AI as a thinking partner
- Has disposable income for self-improvement ($15-30/month is a no-brainer if it works)
- Consumes content from: Ali Abdaal, Huberman, Cal Newport, Sahil Bloom, ADHD TikTok

**Why them first:** They already believe AI can help them. They already feel the pain. They'll adopt fast, give detailed feedback, and evangelize if the product delivers.

---

# Monetization

**Freemium with a clear value gate:**

- **Free:** The initial life mapping conversation + 2 weekly check-ins per month
- **Pro ($15-20/month):** Unlimited weekly check-ins, daily nudges, full life map access, quarterly deep reviews, pattern tracking over time

The free tier must be good enough to experience the magic moment. The paywall sits at *frequency and depth*, not the core experience.

**Why subscription works:** Unlike most productivity apps where value is in the tool, MeOS's value is in *accumulated understanding*. The longer someone uses it, the more irreplaceable it becomes. That's natural retention — not "paying for features" but "this thing knows me."

**Future paths (not now):**

- B2B2C: therapists, coaches, HR teams provisioning MeOS for clients/employees
- Cohort-based: paid group life-planning experiences
- Premium AI: deeper analysis, multi-year trends, life narrative generation

# Go-to-Market Strategy

## Phase 1: Validate the Interaction (Weeks 1-4)

- Build a Custom GPT or Claude Project that runs the life mapping conversation
- Test with 10-20 friends/contacts
- Record reactions. Did they have the "wow, this gets me" moment?
- Start documenting the process publicly (content flywheel begins)

## Phase 2: Build the MVP (Weeks 5-12)

- Simple app (PWA or React Native): voice input → AI life mapping → weekly check-in → basic pattern tracking
- Waitlist via content marketing
- Closed beta with 50-100 users

## Phase 3: Launch the Wedge (Months 4-6)

- Public launch: life mapping → weekly check-in loop
- Product Hunt, subreddits, ADHD communities, productivity Twitter/X
- Content flywheel running (founder journey + user stories)

## Distribution Channels

**Content (primary channel):**

- "I have ADHD and built an AI system that runs my life" — viral video potential
- Weekly "what my AI life partner told me this week" series
- "I did a life mapping session with AI — here's what happened" walkthroughs
- ADHD + productivity content with MeOS as natural CTA

**Platform piggybacking:**

- Custom GPT in GPT Store (free distribution, zero infrastructure)
- Claude Extension when available
- WhatsApp bot for zero-friction entry

**Community seeding:**

- r/ADHD, r/productivity, r/getdisciplined
- ADHD creators on TikTok and YouTube as early users
- Notion/Obsidian communities — "for everyone who bounced off these tools"

# The Irreducible Design Principles

If we build this, we must not lose these properties:

1. **Messy first, structured later** — never force premature organization
2. **Identity before goals** — understand who someone is before telling them what to do
3. **Explicit tradeoffs, not silent ones** — the system forces hard choices
4. **Backlogs as relief, not pressure** — capturing ideas reduces anxiety, doesn't add to it
5. **One compounding engine at a time** — resist the urge to do everything
6. **AI that challenges, not just affirms** — a mirror, not a cheerleader
7. **Artifacts that evolve, not dashboards that judge** — living documents, not scorecards
8. **Fast loops back to reality** — insight must become action quickly
