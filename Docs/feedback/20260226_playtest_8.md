# MeOS Playtest 8 — Bug Report & Feedback
**Date:** February 25, 2026 (Week 2, Day 3)
**Tester:** Tom (founder self-test)
**Build:** Current production

## Summary

Continuing internal playtesting of the daily rhythm flow (Open the Day, Day Plan, Quick Capture) and cross-feature navigation. Three issues identified — one P0 (data not persisting), one P1 (broken contextual navigation), and one P2 (feature suggestion). Day close conversation bug from previous session has been fixed.

## P0: Day Plan Not Populated After "Open the Day" Session

### What happened
Completed the "Open the Day" morning session successfully. The Home screen then showed a prompt to view the day plan. Clicked through to the Day view, but the Day Plan was empty — "No plan for this day."

### Expected behavior
After completing "Open the Day," the Day view should show the intention and any structured output generated during the morning session. The whole point of the morning ritual is that it *produces* a visible day plan artifact.

### Screenshots
- Home screen shows the "Open the Day" card with the prompt to view the day plan *(reference: uploaded screenshot 4 — Day view with "Open the Day" button and captured thoughts)*
- Day view shows "No plan for this day" despite having completed the morning session *(reference: uploaded screenshot 3 — empty Day view)*

### Investigation needed
1. Is the day plan being generated by Sage during the "Open the Day" session? (Check if the structured output block is being emitted)
2. If generated, is it being persisted to the database? (Check the day_plans table or equivalent)
3. If persisted, is the Day view fetching it? (Check the query — possible date isolation bug similar to the one fixed previously)
4. Is there a timezone mismatch between when the plan is stored and what date the Day view queries for?

### Priority
**P0** — This breaks the core "capture down, synthesize up" loop. If the morning ritual doesn't visibly produce anything, users won't return for a second morning session. This is the same class of bug as the previous date isolation issue.

## P1: "Explore with Sage" Deep Link Drops Context

### What happened
On the Day view, a "Something to Sit With" widget appeared with a reflective question: *"What pattern keeps showing up that you haven't named yet?"* with an "Explore with Sage" CTA. Tapped it.

Instead of opening a conversation seeded with that specific question, it:
1. Opened the generic conversation view
2. Showed a session-resumption prompt: "Hey — we were in the middle of things. Want to pick up where we left off, or start fresh?"
3. After selecting "Let's continue," Sage resumed the life mapping session and suggested exploring unmapped domains

### Expected behavior
Tapping "Explore with Sage" from a contextual widget should open a conversation **seeded with that specific question**. Sage's opening message should reference the prompt directly, e.g.: *"That's a great question to sit with — what pattern keeps showing up that you haven't named yet? Let's explore that."*

### Screenshots
- The "Something to Sit With" widget *(reference: uploaded screenshot 1)*
- The session-resumption screen that appeared instead *(reference: uploaded screenshot 2)*

### Root cause
The "Explore with Sage" CTA is likely just navigating to `/chat` without passing any payload. The chat view then falls through to its default session-state logic (mid_conversation → resume prompt).

### Suggested fix
Implement deep linking with context payload:
1. "Explore with Sage" should navigate with a query parameter or state payload containing the question text and the source widget type
2. The chat view should check for an incoming context payload on mount
3. If present, start a new **ad-hoc conversation** (not a structured session like life mapping or check-in) with the question as Sage's opening
4. The session type could be something like `exploration` or `prompted_reflection` — lightweight, no structured output required

### Priority
**P1** — This is a trust-eroding moment. The widget creates a specific, evocative promise and the app breaks it. Every time a CTA says "Explore with Sage" and Sage doesn't know what the user came to explore, it undermines the feeling that "this thing knows me."

## P2: Unexplored Domains Nudge (Feature Suggestion)

### Observation
The life map has several unexplored domains. There's no visible indicator anywhere in the app encouraging the user to complete them.

### Suggestion
Add a gentle nudge on the **Home screen** (not the Day view) surfacing unexplored domains. Something like:

> **Your Life Map**
> 3 of 8 domains mapped · [Explore more →]

Or a card: *"You haven't explored Health, Finances, or Creative Pursuits yet. Want to go deeper?"* — linking to a life mapping continuation session.

### Design considerations
- **Home screen = yes.** This is where orientation and nudging belong.
- **Day view = no.** The Day view should feel present-tense and focused. Adding "you still have homework" energy here would conflict with the daily rhythm's purpose.
- Keep it gentle — this is an invitation, not a progress bar with 37.5% completion guilt.
- The CTA should deep-link to a life mapping continuation session pre-seeded with the unexplored domains as quick-reply options.

### Priority
**P2** — Nice to have. Not blocking anything, but would help drive life map completeness over time, which makes every other feature (check-ins, day planning, pattern detection) richer.

## Previously Fixed

- **Day Close conversations not ending** — Patch was pushed previously. Confirmed fixed in this session.

## Notes for Claude Code

When investigating these issues, pay particular attention to:

1. **The data flow for "Open the Day"**: Session conversation → structured output parsing → database persistence → Day view fetch. Where does it break?
2. **Navigation routing**: How do CTAs like "Explore with Sage" currently navigate? Is there any mechanism for passing context/payload to the chat view?
3. **Session state machine**: The P1 bug suggests the session state check is overriding incoming navigation context. The chat view should check for deep-link payloads *before* falling through to session-state default behavior.
