## 🚨 P0 — Ship-Blocking Bug

### Session Persistence / Return to Active Conversation

**Problem:** During the onboarding life-mapping conversation (after receiving the spider chart), accidentally navigating away from the conversation makes it impossible to return. Pressing the orb on the home screen or the Chat tab only opens a new conversation — the original onboarding conversation is lost.

**Expected behavior:** User should be able to return to their active onboarding conversation from any screen. The system should track whether onboarding is in progress and route the user back to the existing session rather than creating a new one.

**Implementation requirements:**

1. **Track onboarding state in user profile / session store.** Add a field like `onboarding_status` with values: `not_started`, `in_progress`, `completed`. Also store the `active_session_id` for the onboarding conversation.

2. **Route logic for Chat entry points.** When user taps the orb, "Talk to Sage" button, or Chat tab:
   - If `onboarding_status === 'in_progress'` AND `active_session_id` exists → load that conversation (resuming where they left off)
   - If `onboarding_status === 'completed'` → create new conversation or show conversation list
   - If `onboarding_status === 'not_started'` → start onboarding flow

3. **Persist conversation state server-side.** The conversation messages and any structured data generated mid-session (e.g., pulse check ratings, domain card outputs) must survive navigation away and back. Ensure all messages are saved to Supabase in real-time, not only on session "completion."

4. **Add a "Resume" affordance on home screen.** If onboarding is in-progress, the home screen should prominently show a "Continue your conversation with Sage" card/button instead of the default "Talk to Sage."

5. **Edge cases to handle:**
   - App backgrounded and killed during onboarding → should resume on next open
   - Browser refresh during onboarding → should resume
   - User explicitly wants to start over → provide an escape hatch (e.g., settings or long-press), but this should be intentional, not the default

## 🟡 P1 — UX Improvements

### 1. Intake Mini-Conversation: Form vs. Conversation Framing

**Current state:** The intake flow (screens 1–4) uses a chat-bubble UI with quick-reply buttons only. It looks like a conversation but behaves like a branching form. No free-text or voice input is available.

**Problem:** This creates an uncanny valley — the user expects conversational flexibility but gets rigid multiple choice. This can set expectations *lower* than the actual product delivers, which is the opposite of what onboarding should do.

**Recommended approach (pick one):**

**Option A — Own the form.** Remove the chat-bubble framing. Present the intake as a clean, minimal multi-step form (cards that swipe or transition). Keep the warm tone in the copy but don't pretend it's a conversation. Reserve the chat UI for the actual conversation with Sage, making it feel like a distinct upgrade when users arrive there.

**Option B — Make it a real mini-conversation.** Add a free-text input field and/or voice button alongside the quick replies. Let Sage respond dynamically to typed/spoken answers. This is more complex to build but makes the transition to the life-mapping conversation seamless.

**Recommendation for MVP:** Option A. It's faster to build, avoids the uncanny valley entirely, and creates a clear "now we're really talking" moment when the conversation begins.

### 2. Pulse Check Rating UI (Domain Gut Rating)

**Current state:** Five empty circles in a row between "ROUGH" and "THRIVING" labels. Large amounts of whitespace above and below. "tap to rate" hint text below.

**Problems identified:**
- Circles are unlabeled — first-time users don't know what they represent (1–5? Sizes?)
- The sparse layout invites overthinking (ironic given the "don't overthink" instruction)
- No visual feedback until you tap — the circles all look the same
- The gradient from rough to thriving could be clearer visually

**Recommended fixes:**

1. **Add numbers or subtle labels.** Put small numbers (1–5) inside or below each circle. Or use sizing (small → large circles) to imply the scale without numbers.

2. **Add color gradient as hint.** The circles could have a subtle background gradient — warm red/orange on the left fading to green on the right — even before the user taps.

3. **Reduce dead space.** Tighten the vertical spacing. The domain name and scale should feel more connected, not floating in a void. Consider adding a very subtle illustration or emoji for each domain to add warmth.

4. **Satisfying tap feedback.** When a circle is tapped, it should fill with color (matching the domain status color system: red → orange → yellow → light green → green), perhaps with a subtle haptic/animation. The selected state should feel decisive.

5. **Auto-advance after selection.** After tapping a rating, auto-advance to the next domain after a brief delay (~500ms). This keeps the "don't overthink it" energy. Show a subtle transition animation.

6. **Progress indicator.** The "1 of 8" is good — keep it. Consider also showing a thin progress bar at the top.

## 🟢 P2 — Observations & Polish

### What's Working Well

- **Warm color palette and typography** — The amber/cream tones and the warm gray text feel right. This does not feel like a clinical app.
- **Sage's conversational tone** — "That's really helpful context" and "Don't overthink it" feel natural and warm. The coaching voice is landing.
- **The "What do you mean by gut rating?" option** — This is a great trust-building escape hatch. Shows Sage is responsive, not just on rails.
- **The branching logic in intake** — "I'm starting something new" → "Is this something you chose or something that happened to you?" is thoughtful and shows Sage is actually tailoring the experience.

### Minor Polish Items

- **Quick reply button styling:** The quick-reply buttons at the bottom of the chat screen could use slightly more visual weight — they blend into the background a bit. Consider a subtle border or slightly more contrast.
- **Back button behavior:** Verify that the back chevron (‹) on the chat screens does the right thing — it should go back to the previous intake step, not exit the entire flow.
- **Message spacing:** In images 3 and 4, there's a lot of dead space between Sage's message and the quick-reply buttons at the bottom. Consider anchoring the buttons closer to the last message or using a sticky footer approach.

## Testing Checklist (Post-Fix)

After implementing the P0 fix, resume playtest with this checklist:

- [ ] Complete full onboarding conversation without interruption
- [ ] Intentionally navigate away mid-onboarding → verify return to conversation
- [ ] Intentionally close/refresh browser mid-onboarding → verify resume
- [ ] Complete pulse check for all 8 domains → verify data saves
- [ ] Reach spider chart → verify it renders correctly
- [ ] Complete life-mapping conversation for at least 2 domains
- [ ] Verify domain cards appear inline and are editable
- [ ] Verify synthesis card appears at session end
- [ ] Navigate to Life Map view → verify data from conversation appears
- [ ] Return to Home screen → verify it reflects completed onboarding state
