# Playtest Round 3 — Complete Findings & Implementation Specs

**Date:** 2026-02-17  
**Status:** Full playtest complete (onboarding → pulse check → spider chart → life mapping × 2 domains → synthesis → home screen → life map view)

---

## Summary of Session

Ran a complete playtest of the end-to-end flow. Core onboarding bugs were fixed mid-session. Sage's conversational quality is genuinely strong — the relationships exploration in particular demonstrated coach-quality reframing and insight extraction. The main structural issue is session length: two domains already felt long, and the current design implies eight. Post-conversation screens (home, life map) are in good shape with specific improvements needed.

### Bugs Fixed During This Session (No Action Needed)

- Session persistence / return to active conversation
- Post-onboarding pulse check not recognized in conversation
- 406 console errors (`.single()` → `.maybeSingle()`)
- Empty conversation after spider chart

---

## 🔴 P0 — Session Length: Cap First Session at 2-3 Domains

### Problem

The current flow implies the user should explore all 8 domains in their first life-mapping session. Two domain explorations already felt long (~25 min). Eight domains at this depth would be a 90-minute marathon — far beyond the "20-40 minute" target in the vision doc and well past what any new user will tolerate.

### Design Decision

The pulse check IS the lightweight first pass. It gives Sage enough signal to prioritize. The first life-mapping conversation should go deep on **2-3 domains max** — the ones with the lowest pulse ratings or most interesting contrasts.

### Implementation

**Update the life-mapping system prompt** to include session structure:

```
SESSION STRUCTURE FOR FIRST LIFE MAPPING:

1. OPENING: Acknowledge the pulse check data. Identify the 2-3 domains 
   that look most interesting to explore first (lowest rated, sharpest 
   contrasts, or connected tensions).

2. FRAME THE SESSION: Tell the user explicitly: "Based on your snapshot, 
   I want to dig into [Domain A] and [Domain B] first — that's where the 
   real tension seems to live. We'll explore the rest over the next few 
   sessions."
   
   This does three things:
   - Sets expectations for session length (not all 8 today)
   - Creates a natural reason to come back
   - Shows Sage is being strategic, not just going down a list

3. EXPLORE 2-3 DOMAINS: Deep, thorough exploration as currently designed. 
   Generate a domain card after each.

4. AFTER 2-3 DOMAINS: Offer to keep going OR wrap up. Default toward 
   wrapping up: "We've covered a lot of ground. Want to keep going, or 
   is this a good place to synthesize what we've found?"

5. SYNTHESIS: Generate synthesis card based on explored domains only. 
   Reference unexplored domains as "areas to dig into next time."

6. BRIDGE TO NEXT SESSION: "Next time we talk, I'd love to explore 
   [remaining priority domains]. In the meantime, here's what I'd 
   suggest focusing on..."
```

**Update the "Explore with Sage" CTAs on the Life Map view** (image 4) so that tapping one opens a new conversation focused on that specific domain, with Sage aware of all previously explored context.

### Why This Matters

Unexplored domains aren't a deficit — they're a retention mechanic. Each one is a reason to come back. The user sees "3 of 8 explored" on their life map and feels curiosity, not incompleteness. This directly supports the weekly check-in cadence: Week 1 you map Finances and Relationships, Week 2's check-in naturally extends into Career, and so on.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sage opens first life-mapping session by proposing 2-3 priority domains (not all 8)
- [ ] Sage explicitly tells the user they won't cover everything today
- [ ] After 2-3 domains, Sage defaults toward wrapping up
- [ ] Synthesis card references only explored domains; mentions unexplored ones as future topics
- [ ] Life Map view shows unexplored domains with "Explore with Sage" CTAs that launch domain-specific conversations
- [ ] Session completes in ~20-30 minutes

## 🔴 P0 — Conversation Flow: Defer Prescriptions to Synthesis

### Problem

During domain exploration, Sage proposes concrete action items (e.g., "Let's set up a weekly Sunday money check-in") before seeing the full picture. After exploring only Finances, Sage doesn't know if spending is the core issue or a symptom of the startup anxiety that emerges later. Prescriptions this early feel premature — the system hasn't earned the right.

### Design Principle

"Identity before goals — understand who someone is before telling them what to do."

### Implementation

**Update the life-mapping system prompt** with an exploration mode constraint:

```
EXPLORATION MODE (active during domain mapping):
- Your job is to understand, reflect, connect, and synthesize
- You may NOTE potential action items ("this sounds like something worth 
  building a habit around") but do NOT lock them in or ask the user to commit
- Do NOT propose specific check-ins, schedules, or routines
- Do NOT ask "what day of the week works for you?" or similar commitment questions
- You earn the right to prescribe by first demonstrating you understand the full picture

SYNTHESIS MODE (active after all priority domains explored):
- NOW you propose 2-3 concrete next steps informed by the full conversation
- Recommendations should reference cross-domain connections
  (e.g., "Your spending connects to your runway anxiety, which connects 
  to the startup timing question")
- Each recommendation should feel earned by the conversation, not generic
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] During domain exploration, Sage does not propose commitments, schedules, or routines
- [ ] Sage may acknowledge potential actions but explicitly defers ("We'll come back to this")
- [ ] Synthesis card includes concrete recommendations informed by cross-domain understanding
- [ ] Active Commitments on home screen reflect synthesis recommendations, not mid-exploration proposals

## 🟠 P1 — New Feature: Evolving Artifact Sidebar

### Concept

The conversation is the input. The life map is the output. Right now these live on separate screens, which means users must trust the conversation is "going somewhere" without seeing evidence. The artifact sidebar makes the output visible *during* the conversation — users watch their life map build in real time as they talk.

This also addresses the session length concern: when users can SEE their map filling in, the conversation feels productive rather than long. Empty domain slots become visible promises, not invisible gaps.

### User Experience

#### Entry Point

When the life-mapping conversation begins, the sidebar is visible by default on desktop and accessible via a floating indicator on mobile.

#### What the Sidebar Shows

1. **Spider chart (compact, ~200px width)** — Pulse check data. As domains are explored, the corresponding spoke subtly pulses or updates color to indicate "mapped" vs. "rated only."

2. **Domain card slots (8 total)** — Vertically arranged below the spider chart:
   - **Pre-exploration:** Domain name + pulse rating, muted card with dashed border. "Not yet explored" label. These are the promises — visible but unfilled.
   - **Active exploration:** When Sage is currently discussing a domain, that card highlights with subtle glow or border change. Animated indicator signals "generating..."
   - **Completed:** Once domain card is generated in conversation, sidebar slot fills with condensed version: status color dot, one-line current state, stated intention. Satisfying fade-in transition.

3. **Cross-cutting insights (appears after 2+ domains)** — "Emerging patterns" section at bottom. Populates with tensions and connections Sage identifies across domains. Starts empty, grows as conversation progresses.

4. **Progress indicator** — "2 of 8 domains explored" with subtle progress bar. Not gamified, just informational.

5. **Synthesis preview (end of session)** — When synthesis is generated, sidebar transforms to show complete life map summary: narrative, priorities, tensions, boundaries.

```

- Sidebar width: ~320px, collapsible via toggle button
- Conversation panel takes remaining width
- Sidebar scrolls independently from conversation

#### Mobile Layout

1. **Floating progress pill** at top of chat: "Life Map · 2/8 explored" with mini radial indicator. Tapping opens bottom sheet (70% screen height).
2. **Domain completion toast** — Brief toast at top when domain card is generated: "✓ Relationships mapped"
3. **Bottom sheet** — Same content as desktop sidebar. Swipe down to dismiss.

### Data Architecture

No new APIs needed. Piggyback on existing domain card generation:
1. When Sage generates domain summary → parsed → `upsertDomain` writes to Supabase (already happening)
2. Sidebar component subscribes to life map data store → re-renders on domain upsert
3. Cross-cutting insights: store as JSON on session record or in a `session_insights` table

### When to Show

| Context | Sidebar Behavior |
|---|---|
| Life-mapping conversation | Visible by default (desktop), floating pill (mobile) |
| Weekly check-in | Show if life map data exists; highlight discussed domains |
| Ad-hoc conversation | Hidden by default, available via toggle |
| Non-chat screens | Not applicable |

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1 (build now):** Desktop sidebar. Spider chart + domain card slots that populate as conversation progresses. Static rendering — reads from Supabase on domain card generation events. No cross-cutting insights yet.

**Phase 2 (post-launch):** Mobile bottom sheet + floating pill. Real-time updates via Supabase realtime. Cross-cutting insights section. "Still generating..." teaser states.

**Phase 3 (future):** Sidebar persists across sessions showing historical changes. Animated transitions on data updates.

### Acceptance Criteria (Phase 1)

- [ ] Desktop: Right sidebar visible during life-mapping conversations
- [ ] Sidebar shows compact spider chart with pulse check data
- [ ] 8 domain card slots visible — unexplored shown as muted/empty
- [ ] When domain card generated in conversation, corresponding sidebar slot fills in
- [ ] Sidebar collapsible via toggle
- [ ] Sidebar scrolls independently from conversation
- [ ] Progress indicator: "X of 8 domains explored"
- [ ] Sidebar hidden during ad-hoc conversations
- [ ] No performance degradation on conversation flow

## 🟡 P1 — Home Screen Refinements

### What's Working

The home screen (images 5-6) is the strongest non-conversation screen in the app. Key wins:

- **"Your North Star"** card is the highest-value artifact. "Build the runway to jump" is synthesis-quality output phrased in the user's emotional language. This is what users will screenshot.
- **Boundaries section** is a smart inclusion — anti-goals are a differentiator
- **Next Check-in card** with "Start early" button is clean
- **Voice orb** at the bottom with "Continue your conversation" is a strong CTA
- Overall visual hierarchy reads well — greeting → reflection → priorities → actions → next session

### Fixes Needed

1. **"Something to sit with" should be pre-filled, not an empty prompt.** Current copy ("What came up in your session that you want to sit with?") reads as a question, not a reflection. This should contain a specific provocation from the session — the most unresolved tension or the most surprising thing the user said. Example: *"You said you'd hurt if she chose friendship. What does that tell you about what you actually want?"* This card should be generated by Sage during synthesis, not left for the user to fill.

2. **Active Commitments should come from synthesis, not mid-exploration.** Currently these include "First Sunday money check-in" and "Rebalance Amazon RSU position (this week)" which were proposed before the full picture emerged. Once the P0 prompt fix is in place, these should reflect cross-domain-aware recommendations from the synthesis phase.

3. **Boundaries: verify grounding in conversation.** "Not jumping into founder mode without the 9-month psychological buffer" — the "9-month" figure doesn't appear in the conversation I observed. Boundaries must be grounded in what the user actually said, not Sage's extrapolations. If Sage infers a number, it should be flagged as an inference and editable.

4. **Consider adding the compact spider chart to the home screen.** It's the most visual, instantly recognizable artifact the user has generated. Showing it on home (small, tappable to expand) reinforces "this system knows me" on every return visit.

## 🟡 P1 — Life Map View Refinements

### Current State (Image 4)

Clean, functional layout. Explored domains (Relationships, Finances) show as expanded cards with summaries. Unexplored domains show with pulse ratings and "Explore with Sage" CTAs.

### Fixes Needed

1. **"Explore with Sage" should launch a domain-specific conversation.** When tapped, it should open a new conversation (or continue the active one) with Sage pre-primed to explore that specific domain, with full context from previously explored domains. This is how users complete their life map over multiple sessions.

2. **Status labels need review.** Both explored domains show "Stable" but Finances was clearly more fraught than Relationships based on the conversation. Verify the status assignment logic — it should reflect the conversation content, not just the pulse rating.

3. **Add the spider chart at the top of the Life Map view.** Users rated 8 domains in the pulse check — the spider chart should be the visual anchor at the top of this view, with domain cards below. Currently the spider chart only appears on the post-onboarding screen and then disappears.

4. **Explored domains should show richer preview.** The truncated one-liners ("35, single, recently re-engaged with dating (apps, setting u...") aren't very useful. Consider showing the key tension as the preview line instead — that's the most valuable insight per domain.

## 🟡 P1 — UX Polish Items

### Intake Mini-Conversation

Current chat-bubble UI with quick-reply-only interaction creates an uncanny valley — looks conversational but behaves like a form. Recommendation: either own the form (remove chat-bubble framing) or keep current approach and accept the tradeoff. Not a blocker for user testing.

### Pulse Check Rating UI

- Add small numbers (1–5) inside or below circles
- Add subtle color gradient hint across circles (warm red → green) before selection
- Tighten vertical spacing
- Satisfying tap feedback: fill with domain status color + subtle scale animation
- Consider auto-advance after ~500ms delay

### Spider Chart Blurb

Replace generic "Looks like things are generally okay..." with a lightweight model call (Haiku-level) that generates a specific observation based on actual ratings. Fallback: simple conditional logic identifying highest/lowest domains and contrasts.

### Quick Reply Button Styling

Buttons blend into background. Add subtle border or more contrast.

### Message Spacing in Chat

Large dead space between Sage's messages and quick-reply buttons. Anchor buttons closer to last message or use sticky footer.

## 🟢 P2 — What's Working Well

### Conversational Quality

Sage's coaching quality is consistently strong across both domain explorations:

**Finances:** Identified the "security vs. freedom" tension, picked up on tentative language about expenses, escalated from tactical (spending) to strategic (is this a side project or a full-time leap?), drew out "I know in my bones I need to start my own company."

**Relationships:** Reframed "struggling" as "active but uncertain." Asked "Do you actually want a relationship right now, or do you want to want one?" — a genuinely insightful coaching question. Distinguished between external pressure (parents, societal timeline) and internal reality. Proposed re-rating the domain based on the conversation, which the user accepted.

The domain cards generated from both conversations are accurate, well-structured, and capture the real tensions — not just surface-level summaries.

### Visual Design

Warm palette and typography remain cohesive. The voice orb on the home screen is visually inviting. Domain cards are well-structured with clear information hierarchy.

## Strategic Note: What to Build Next

### Recommended Priority Stack

1. **Fix session length (P0)** — Prompt update, testable immediately. Cap at 2-3 domains, frame remaining as retention hooks.

2. **Fix prescription timing (P0)** — Prompt update, testable immediately. Defer action items to synthesis.

3. **Build artifact sidebar Phase 1 (P1)** — Desktop only. Makes the first session feel more magical and addresses the "is this going anywhere?" anxiety.

4. **Test weekly check-in flow end-to-end** — This is the retention engine and it hasn't been validated yet. The check-in needs to: reference previous session, note what's changed, surface patterns, and naturally extend into unexplored domains.

5. **Home screen refinements (P1)** — Pre-fill "Something to sit with," ground Boundaries in conversation, add spider chart.

### What to Defer

- **Personal OS layer** (desktop metaphor, daily planning, calendar integrations) — This is Layer 2-3. Premature until the core loop (map → check-in → return) is validated with real users.
- **Mobile-specific sidebar** — Desktop sidebar first, mobile in Phase 2.
- **Cross-cutting insights in sidebar** — Phase 2 feature, after basic sidebar is validated.

### The Core Question to Answer Next

> Do users who complete life mapping come back for a weekly check-in?

Everything on the priority stack above serves this question. Session length affects completion rate. Prescription timing affects trust. The sidebar affects perceived value. The check-in flow IS the retention test. Answer this question before building the Personal OS layer.
